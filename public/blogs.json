        "ans": "1. Authentication is the process of identifying the user through their unique identity(email/user-id) and password. On the other hand, Authorization is the process for checking the resource accessing privilege of an authenticated user. 2. Authentication of a user is done before determining his/her authorization of the resources(e.g. payment page, checkout page of a website)."

        "ans": "We are using firebase for authentication and hosting purposes. Firebase is allowing the developers to identify the users using email/password, phone number and other identity providers like github, google, facebook, etc. It provides easier, more secure and trustworthy authentication system than our own created manual login and register system. <br/> Other than firebase, we have Parse, Back4app, Heroku, Kuzzle, Deployd, Kinvey, Backendless, Pubnub, Kumulous, etc."
